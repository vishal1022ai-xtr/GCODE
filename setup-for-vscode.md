## 🚀 How to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Using Replit's Git Interface (Recommended)

1. **Open the Git panel** in Replit (left sidebar)
2. **Stage all changes** by clicking the "+" next to each file
3. **Commit changes** with message: "Setup VSCode configuration and enhanced project structure"
4. **Connect to GitHub** using Replit's GitHub integration
5. **Push to GitHub** using the Git panel

### Option 2: Manual Git Commands (If needed)

If Replit's Git interface isn't working, you can use these commands in Replit's shell:

```bash
# Remove any Git lock files
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Setup VSCode configuration and enhanced project structure"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/mediminder-ai.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 Running in VSCode (After GitHub Push)

1. **Clone from GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mediminder-ai.git
   cd mediminder-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create `.env.local` file:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Open in VSCode**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

5. **Install recommended extensions** (VSCode will prompt you)

6. **Start development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
